# Employee-Tracker

## Description

I was presented with the following challenge from a user:

AS A business owner
I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
SO THAT I can organize and plan my business

Using mysql and inquirer, I created a database that will allow the user to update as needed.


## Installation

The user will need to be able to access mysql, and will need to download the project modules with the following versions to be installed:

-console.table: "^0.10.0",
-express: "^4.17.1",
-inquirer: "^8.2.4",
-jshint: "^2.12.0",
-mysql2: "^2.2.5"
